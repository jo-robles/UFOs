# UFO Sightings

# Overview of Project: 

Utilizing information from alleged UFO sightings, a website has been created allowing users to dynamically search for items on a webpage utilizing JavaScript. 

# Resources Utilized:
* Visual Studio Code
* HTML
* JavaScript
* js Folder:
    * data.js - Dataset of alleged UFO sightings
* static Folder:
    * apps.js - JavaScript file powering website to allow for dynamic user searches.

# Results: 

On the website (titled index.html), users will find the following Filter Search criteria section on the left-hand side of the webpage:

The following filters have now been added to the website:

A user has the ability to enter in search criteria into the text boxes and the dataset on the right will automatically update based on the criteria entered. As a result of the coding itself, a user may enter multiple criteria options to find specific examples that are being sought. For example, in this example, the user has searched for "UFO" sightings that are in the US and that are listed as shape: circle.

As evidenced, the website updated dynamically after putting the criteria in the text boxes and returned the information being searched for. 

# Summary: 

While the overall website has now been improved from the original design, and is certainly more dynamic, one drawback that has been presented is the inability for the user to export or save any searches that are completed. As a result, the user must continuously visit the website in multiple sessions if multiple searches are desired. Such a design could ultimately tax Dana's hosting ability.

Therefore, and in consideration of another possible improvement to the website, the following recommendations are presented:

* Add the ability for the user to export their results as a CSV file.
    * Doing so will eliminate the need for the user to visit the website multiple times if searches are desired. 
    
* Add in the ability for the user to search in the "comments" field.
    * Currently, the user cannot search within the comments in the dataset. Adding the ability for the user to search for specific keywords would greatly enhance the functionality of the website.
